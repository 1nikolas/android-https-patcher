# Android HTTPS patcher
Patch your android app with self-signed certificate to sniff https traffic. Should work both release and debug builds.

## Usage
```
python apk_rebuild.py -i input.apk -o output.apk
```
Run python script and follow the instructions. After you've done drag output file into your emulator. Use `Charles`, `BurpSuite` or any other tooling for request sniffing.
